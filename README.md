# Rail-Shooter
A train-based arcade game.
Think of it as 1942 on rails, and with more "touch-friendly" controls.

This game is being developed on a HP Jornada 720 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jornada_%28PDA%29#Jornada_720) running a older version of Debian Linux - hence the bigger commits (I have to rsync the code into my Mac from time to time).
